## Fonts directory
I used some windows default fonts for the menus,
they can be found under ```"C:\Windows\Fonts"```.
(You can choose the font files in settings.py)

Additionally, I used fontawesome for icons, which is also
used by [luma.examples](https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.examples/tree/master/examples/fonts)
and can be downloaded on [the Font Awesome Website](https://fontawesome.com/download)

The files are not uploaded because of the copyright.
